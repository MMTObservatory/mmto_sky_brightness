Summary of earlier sky brightness measurements and suggestions for 2019

-----

Massey & Foltz 2000 paper
1988 obs: MMT, Blue Channel, 300 lpmm grating, 
two 5" diam circular apertures, 300 sec exposure, tracking near zenith (ZD 5 deg)

1998 obs (Berlind) 1.5m + FAST, 300 lpmm grating
5" slit, 1800 sec exposure
at zenith and 4 cardinal pounts at zenith dist ~50 deg (eastern at ZD=35 deg)
actual az/el pairs:
Zenith=?,85.  N= 0,42.  E=0,56.  S=180,40.  W=270,47.

Davis & Luginbuhl suggestions for directions
Zenith, ZD=5 deg
Rosemont
Benson/Vigneto
Tucson (use AZ=0, ZD=70,48)
Nogales (use AZ=180, ZD=70,50)

Bearings (ie azimuth):
Rosemont  37.6 deg
Vigneto   67.5 deg
Tucson   351.9 deg, = -8.1 deg
Nogales  186.6 deg

----------

Inst Setup 2019

Blue Channel, 300 lpmm grating, CWL 5800 A, no blocking filter
5" slit, or two 5" diam circles
also use 1" slit for wavelength calibrations

Calibrations: 
HeNeAr 1" slit - 30 sec, 300 sec?
HeNeAr 5" slit - 30 sec only
BC Flats - 30 sec?

For October 5 2019

Sky positions
Take all with tracking on
Take 3 x 180 sec at each position?

In early October, at ~ midnight the Milky Way will be in the
north and east.  You can likely do the east AZ=90, EL~45 pointing near
midnight before the MW moves across it, and maybe the north EL-45
pointing. After that, consider doing the zenith, south and west pointings, 
and later trying the north, east, and Rosemont/Vigneto (which are both northeast), after the MW has moved somewhat out of the way.  The north 
low pointing will probably be the first of these to be clear of the MW.
The NE el=45 pointings may not be clear of the MW until 3:30-4 AM.


              AZ      EL      Notes
Zenith       270      85      (1)
Rosemont      37.6    45      or EL=42
Vigneto       67.5    45      or EL=42
Tucson       351.9    42      EL=42 matches Massey & Foltz
Nogales      186.6    40      EL=40 matches Massey & Foltz
East          90      56      EL=56 matches Massey & Foltz
West         270      47      EL=47 matches Massey & Foltz
(North         0     ~45)     redundant with Tucson?
(South       180     ~45)     redundant with Nogales?

You can also try a low elevation of 20 or 30 deg in each direction.


Notes: 
1. suggest doing the near zenith pointing at west AZ=270 rather than east, so you don't track through zenith.

The sky is going to move about 5 deg during a 10 minute series of exposures,
so in my opinion, it isn't worth worrying over few-degree differences
in elevation, or the difference in direction between the cardinal points 
and Tucson or Nogales.

LMST is about 0:30 at midnight and 5:30 at twilight.
